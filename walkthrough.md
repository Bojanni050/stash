## 2026-10-07 (Fix CLI forget/purge command tree)

- Findings: `cmd/cli/main.go` declared the top-level `forget` command twice verbatim (a merge artifact), and the `purge` command carried a stray `forget` child — a soft-delete nested under a hard-delete command, which made `stash purge forget` nonsensical. Separately, `purgeFactCmd` in `cmd/cli/commands.go` was defined but never registered, so `stash purge fact` did not exist even though its handler was written. This surfaced while onboarding a new contributor and inspecting the command tree.
- Conclusions: The fix is purely structural and the intended shape is unambiguous: a single top-level `forget`, and a `purge` command with two children (`episode` and `fact`). No design decision was required, so it was done as a self-contained first-PR-sized change rather than folded into anything larger. The migration numbering gap (no `00003`) was deliberately left alone — goose does not care and renumbering migrations is riskier than it looks.
- Actions: Edited `cmd/cli/main.go` — removed the duplicate `forget` block, removed the stray `forget` nested under `purge`, and added a `fact` child (`Action: purgeFactCmd`) beside `episode`. Committed as `52abad5` on `main` (fork `Bojanni050/stash`). Validated with `git diff --check` (clean) and manual indentation review; `go build` / `go vet` / `gofmt` were NOT run because no Go toolchain is installed in the environment.

## 2026-10-07 (Add CI workflow)

- Findings: `.github/workflows/` contained only `release.yml`, which runs on published releases. Pull requests were therefore never compiled or tested, so a structurally broken CLI command tree (the duplicate `forget` / unreachable `purge fact` issue above) could merge unnoticed.
- Conclusions: Added a minimal CI workflow running `go vet`, `go build` and `go test` on pushes to `main` and on pull requests. A `gofmt`/formatting gate was deliberately left out, because the tree is not guaranteed to be gofmt-clean (inconsistent indentation existed in `cmd/cli/main.go`), which would make CI fail on introduction; a dedicated formatting pass is better done as its own change.
- Actions: Added `.github/workflows/ci.yml`. Not validated locally (no Go toolchain; Docker daemon not running). Caveat: GitHub does not run workflows on forked repositories until Actions is explicitly enabled in the fork's settings.

## 2026-10-07 (Bump GitHub Actions to current majors)

- Findings: The first CI run emitted annotations that `actions/checkout@v4` and `actions/setup-go@v5` target the deprecated Node.js 20 (forced onto Node 24). `release.yml` also pinned older majors (`checkout@v4`, `setup-go@v5`, `softprops/action-gh-release@v1`, and `docker/*` at v3–v5).
- Conclusions: Bumped every action in both workflows to its current major, after verifying via the GitHub API that each major tag exists. Moving major tags (e.g. `@v7`) were chosen over pinned patch versions to match the existing convention and keep future updates simple.
- Actions: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` — checkout v4→v7, setup-go v5→v7. `.github/workflows/release.yml` — checkout v4→v7, setup-go v5→v7, action-gh-release v1→v3, setup-qemu v3→v4, setup-buildx v3→v4, login v3→v4, metadata v5→v6, build-push v5→v7. The `ci.yml` bumps are validated by the CI run triggered on this push; `release.yml` only runs on a published release, so its bumps are not exercised until then.

## 2026-10-07 (Apply gofmt and add a formatting gate)

- Findings: `gofmt -l .` flagged 12 files as not gofmt-clean, including `cmd/cli/main.go`, several `internal/brain/*` files and the new `internal/webui/webui.go`. This confirmed the tree was not consistently formatted — the reason the formatter gate was deliberately left out of the initial CI workflow.
- Conclusions: Ran `gofmt -w .` across the repo and added a blocking `gofmt -l` check to `ci.yml`, so formatting is now enforced going forward. Kept as a separate branch/PR because the diff is purely mechanical and is easier to review in isolation from functional changes.
- Actions: Formatted 12 files (indentation/alignment only, no logic changes — verified with `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...` and `go test ./...`, all passing on Go 1.27.1). Added a "Check formatting (gofmt)" step to `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

## 2026-10-09 (Fix docker compose so the dashboard is reachable)

- Findings: README and `docs/GETTING_STARTED.md` promise the web dashboard at `http://localhost:9090/ui` after `docker compose up`, but `docker-compose.yml` ran `mcp serve --with-consolidation` — which starts only the MCP SSE server, not the HTTP/dashboard server — and published only port 8080. So the documented dashboard URL did not work out of the box.
- Conclusions: Fixed the compose rather than the docs, because the dashboard is a real feature and the docs describe the intended first-run experience. Switched the service command to `serve` (starts HTTP + MCP + consolidation together) and published port 9090. Also removed the obsolete top-level `version` key that Docker Compose v2 warns about. On the live host this is fronted by `tailscale serve` (8444 → MCP, 8445 → dashboard), which is environment-specific and stays out of the repo.
- Actions: `docker-compose.yml` — command `mcp serve …` → `serve --http-host 0.0.0.0 --http-port 9090 --mcp-host 0.0.0.0 --mcp-port 8080`; added the `"9090:9090"` port mapping; removed `version: '3.8'`. Validated with `docker compose config` (parses clean, no version warning). No Go changes, so no build was required.

## 2026-10-09 (Guard reasoner output cost: max_tokens + optional JSON mode)

- Findings: LiteLLM usage data showed the `stash` key spending ~$4.62 in total, almost entirely on 2026-10-08 ($4.13): ~10.3M completion tokens versus 1.9M prompt tokens across 3,769 requests — about 2,745 output tokens per call, for responses that should be sub-200-token JSON. Root cause: the configured model was a reasoning-style model and the reasoner sent no `max_tokens`, so nothing capped the output.
- Conclusions: Output tokens, not the architecture, drove the cost. Added a configurable `max_tokens` guard (default 1024; `0` means unlimited, and the field is omitted when 0 so we never request zero output) and an opt-in `response_format=json_object` (default off, because support varies by provider and an unsupported value returns a 400). The eight identical chat call sites were collapsed into one `chat()` helper so request options live in a single place. The real fix remains choosing a non-reasoning instruct model.
- Actions: `internal/reasoner/openai.go` — added `maxTokens`/`jsonMode` fields, a central `chat()` helper, and switched all 8 reasoner methods to it. `internal/config/config.go` — new `STASH_REASONER_MAX_TOKENS` (default 1024) and `STASH_REASONER_JSON_MODE` (default false). `internal/bootstrap/bootstrap.go` — passed both through to the reasoner. `.env.example` — documented both, with a note to prefer a non-reasoning instruct model. Validated with `go build ./...`, `go vet ./...`, `go test ./...` and `gofmt -l .` (all clean).

## 2026-10-09 (Stash weigerde te starten: optionele embedding-overrides waren verplicht)

- Findings: Stash startte niet met `load config: env: required environment variable "STASH_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL" is not set` (en idem voor `STASH_EMBEDDING_API_KEY`), terwijl er wél een URL in `.env` stond. Twee oorzaken die elkaar versterkten: (1) `config.NewFromFile` parseert met `env.Options{RequiredIfNoDef: true}`, wat elk veld zónder `envDefault` verplicht maakt — de twee embedding-overrides hebben geen default, terwijl `bootstrap.go` ze juist als optioneel behandelt (leeg = terugvallen op de OpenAI-instellingen). (2) `docker-compose.yml` gaf die twee vars niet door aan de container, dus zelfs een correcte `.env` bereikte Stash via compose nooit.
- Conclusions: De overrides echt optioneel gemaakt met `envDefault:""` — dat is precies wat `RequiredIfNoDef` als "heeft een default" ziet, dus ze zijn niet meer verplicht — in plaats van `RequiredIfNoDef` weg te halen, zodat het vangnet voor toekomstige velden blijft staan. Compose geeft ze nu door met `${VAR:-}`, zodat een override uit `.env` de container bereikt en leeg blijft als je 'm niet zet. Regressietest toegevoegd zodat dit niet stil terugkomt.
- Actions: `internal/config/config.go` (`envDefault:""` op `EmbeddingBaseURL`/`EmbeddingAPIKey` + comment); `docker-compose.yml` (beide vars doorgeven); nieuw `internal/config/config_test.go` (2 tests: leeg = geen fout en leeg, gezet = gelezen); validated — `go test ./internal/config/...` groen, `go build ./...` groen.
